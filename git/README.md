Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo

1. Repo-session
Create a new directory called git in your repo.

2. Coding fury road
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

3. Collaboration is the base of a company
A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:
-adding a feature in development
-collaborating on the same project with other developers
-not breaking your entire repository
-not upsetting your co-workers
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.

4. Collaboration: be up to date
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.

5. HAAA what did you do???
Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time…

6. Never push too much
Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs).
